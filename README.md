# Dataquest-Guided-Project-Naive-Bayes-Spam-Filter
This Dataquest guided project is based on building a spam filter with a Naive Bayes classifier.
From Dataquest:
'''
We'll use the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm along with a dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified 
by humans.
The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, 
and it can be downloaded from the The UCI Machine Learning Repository.
